### Acquainting yourself with tools

> **Acquainting** yourself with tools in cybersecurity involves learning how to effectively use software, hardware, and techniques to secure digital systems and networks against cyber threats.

#### Nmap & Networking

> Nmap, short for "Network Mapper," is a powerful network scanning and exploration tool used in cybersecurity. It's designed to discover hosts, services, and vulnerabilities within a computer network. Nmap employs various scanning techniques, like TCP, UDP, SYN, and ICMP scans, to identify open ports, services running on those ports, and operating systems. This information is crucial for assessing network security, finding potential entry points, and strengthening defenses against potential threats.

### Priv Escalation

> Privilege escalation (priv esc) is the act of gaining higher levels of access or privileges than initially granted to a user or system. It involves exploiting vulnerabilities to elevate privileges, granting unauthorized access to resources or actions. This can be a critical step for attackers to gain control over a system, making it a crucial focus in security assessments to prevent unauthorized escalation of privileges.
